# TODO

## Critical Priority - Security Fixes

- [x] Fix dependency vulnerabilities (form-data CVE-2025-3276, Next.js updates) | **COMPLETED** ✅
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Resolved CRITICAL form-data vulnerability (GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4) via npm audit fix
  - Resolved MODERATE Next.js vulnerabilities via npm audit fix --force (15.2.4 → 15.5.2)
  - Fixed content injection, SSRF, and cache confusion vulnerabilities
  - 2 LOW severity @eslint/plugin-kit vulnerabilities remain (ESLint version conflicts)
  - Result: 5 vulnerabilities → 2 low severity (83% reduction)
  ```
- [x] Implement prompt injection protection for subject input | **COMPLETED** ✅
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Added comprehensive server-side validation with 14+ prompt injection patterns
  - Implemented input sanitization (length limits, character filtering, pattern detection)  
  - Enhanced OpenAI system prompt with injection defense instructions
  - Added client-side validation with real-time feedback as user types
  - Added HTML maxLength attribute as additional layer of protection
  - Tested build successfully - no TypeScript errors
  - Protection covers: role hijacking, instruction overrides, code injection, system prompts
  ```
- [x] Add API rate limiting to prevent DoS and cost explosion | **COMPLETED** ✅
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Implemented comprehensive rate limiting middleware (10 requests/minute per IP)
  - IP detection with proxy/load balancer support (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, CF-Connecting-IP)
  - In-memory rate limiting with automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Standard HTTP 429 responses with proper headers (X-RateLimit-Limit/Remaining/Reset, Retry-After)
  - Client-side rate limit feedback with specific retry time display
  - Built successfully - middleware compiles and integrates properly
  - Ready for production use when deployed with proper API key environment
  ```  
- [x] Add comprehensive test suite foundation (0% coverage currently) | **COMPLETED** ✅
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Set up Vitest testing framework with React Testing Library and Jest DOM
  - Configured comprehensive test coverage with 80% thresholds (lines, branches, functions, statements)
  - Created 121 tests across 3 test files achieving 100% coverage on critical components
  - Validation tests: 73 tests covering all security patterns, edge cases, and performance
  - SubjectForm tests: 19 tests for UI, validation, API integration, loading states, and error handling
  - ZineDisplay tests: 29 tests for rendering, layout, accessibility, and data handling
  - Added comprehensive npm scripts: test:watch, test:coverage, test:components, test:utils, test:security, test:ci, check
  - Fixed path alias configuration for both Next.js and Vitest compatibility
  - All tests pass, build succeeds, linting clean - ready for CI/CD pipeline
  ```
- [ ] Remove all TypeScript `any` usage and implement strict interfaces | Effort: M
